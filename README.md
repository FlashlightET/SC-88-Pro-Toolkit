# SC-88-Pro-Toolkit
EzoGaming's SC-88Pro Toolkit!!
This is my toolkit that I am working on to generate SysEx (System Exclusive) messages for the Roland Sound Canvas SC-88 Pro. I was originally only concerned with checksum generation.

## GUI
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29938499/227429444-89ab70a9-d616-461d-88e7-f0eaa94371e8.png)
Gui is nowhere near complete but I'm trying to prototype it out. I have no experience with tkinter.

## Other Useful Tools
[Mido](https://github.com/mido/mido) - Python library for working with the MIDI interface and file format

[MIDI-OX](http://www.midiox.com/) - Tool that can send SysEx events manually (however I find mido more convenient)

[Sekaiju](https://openmidiproject.osdn.jp/Sekaiju_en.html) - MIDI editor with convenient event editing

[TMIDI Player](https://blackmidi.fandom.com/wiki/Software:TMIDI_Player) - MIDI player with visualization of parameters (plays at a slightly off speed)
