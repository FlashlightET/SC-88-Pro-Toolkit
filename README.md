# SC-88-Pro-Toolkit
EzoGaming's SC-88Pro Toolkit!!
This is my toolkit that I am working on to generate SysEx (System Exclusive) messages for the Roland Sound Canvas SC-88 Pro. I was originally only concerned with checksum generation.

## GUI

Gui is nowhere near complete but I'm trying to prototype it out. I have no experience with tkinter.
